"""Deterministic repair of malformed tool-call history.

Providers require that every tool call in an assistant turn is answered by
exactly one tool result, placed right after that turn. Interrupted runs and
older persistence paths can break this in several ways: a call with no
result, a result with no call, a result stranded after unrelated messages,
duplicate results for one call, or parallel results saved out of order.

``mend_tool_history`` restores the invariant without guessing:

1. existing results move directly after their calls, in call order;
2. an unanswered call receives an interruption error result;
3. a result whose call is gone is dropped (its arguments cannot be rebuilt);
4. duplicates collapse to one, and a real result beats a synthetic one.

Running it on already-valid history is a no-op, so it is safe to apply on
every load and as a last check before each provider request.
