"""Plan mode: a read-only stance for the agent.

While plan mode is active the session hands the model a restricted tool set
and an extra system-prompt block telling it to research and propose rather
than act.  Two things change:

* Mutating tools (``Write``, ``Edit``) are removed from the tool list, so the
  model cannot call them at all.
* ``Bash`` is wrapped so only commands ``safety.is_safe_command`` recognises
  as read-only are executed; anything else is refused without running.

Nothing here is stateful — ``restrict_tools`` returns a new list and the
caller decides when to apply it.
